## 📖 About the project

This is a group exercise focused on building a minimalist e-commerce platform to practise modern web development patterns.

**Key learnings:**

- Server-side rendering and routing with Next.js 15 App Router
- Type-safe development with TypeScript and Zod validation
- GraphQL API integration with queries, mutations and error-handling
- Implementing mock data fallback for development with environment variables
- Authentication and route protection using Clerk
- Form management with server actions for CRUD operations and contact forms
- Advanced routing patterns with parallel routes and route interception for modals
- Performance optimization through lazy loading and React Suspense
- Dynamic routing with searchParams for filtering and pagination
- Building accessible, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
- Agile methodology with iterative development and continuous feedback & communication.
